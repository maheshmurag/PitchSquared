Our app is a combination of several sound games:
1) The app plays a random violin sounding note and the user tries to match the note by tilting, twisting, moving, 
and shaking the device within a certain amount of time. At the end of the time limit, the application will give the user a score based on how accurate the user is. The app has a pre-set note for a each "tick" (ex: every 30 degree plays a notes) detected by the accelerometer

2) The app plays a simple melody (later, we may be able to allow the user to import their own songs from iTunes) 
and the user tries to match the next note in the melody using movements. There could be easy, medium, and hard 
modes based on the song, and the interface could be similar to Guitar Hero, with prompts instructing the user 
on how to move his/her device. In the easy difficulty, the user has 5-10 seconds to match the next note, while 
on the hard difficulty the user has to “play along” to the melody at a slightly slow-medium speed by tilting and 
moving the device around.
