Our app is a combination of several sound games: 
1) The app plays a random violin sounding note and the user tries to match the note by tilting, twisting, moving, and shaking the device within a certain amount of time. At the end of the time limit, the application will give the user a score based on how accurate the user is. The app has a pre-set note for a each "tick" (ex: every 30 degree plays a notes) detected by the accelerometer

2) The app plays a simple melody (later, we may be able to allow the user to import their own songs from iTunes) and the user tries to match the next note in the melody using movements. There could be easy, medium, and hard modes based on the song, and the interface could be similar to Guitar Hero, with prompts instructing the user on how to move his/her device. In the easy difficulty, the user has 5-10 seconds to match the next note, while on the hard difficulty the user has to “play along” to the melody at a slightly slow-medium speed by tilting and moving the device around. PLEASE NOTE: As of now, this mode is not in the build.

3) The user gets to "jam out" in our freeplay mode. The screen displays the current note that corresponds with the iPad's tilt, and the user can tap on the screen to play said note. There is also a record mode that allows up to 10 seconds of storage and replay capacity.

Additionally, we have an informative "help" screen as well as a high-score screen. Combine this with our polished UI and relaxing color options, and you have Pitch^2, the penultimate motion-based composition sofware (mainly because it is the only one in existence).
